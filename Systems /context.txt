**Simulation Context: Tragedy of the Commons**

**Overview:**
The "Tragedy of the Commons" refers to a situation where individual users, acting independently according to their own self-interest, deplete or spoil a shared limited resource, even though this is contrary to the best long-term interests of the group. This simulation aims to model the behavior of individuals and the consequences of their actions on the shared resource.

**Initial Setup:**
- A community of \( N \) individuals.
- A shared resource (e.g., a common pasture, fishery, water source) with a replenishment rate \( R \) per time unit.
- Each individual has the choice to use a certain amount \( A_i \) of the resource.

**Parameters:**
- \( N \): Total number of individuals.
- \( C \): Carrying capacity of the resource.
- \( R \): Replenishment rate of the resource per time unit.
- \( A_i \): Amount of resource used by individual \( i \) per time unit.
- \( U \): Utility gained by an individual from using the resource.

**Rules:**
1. **Resource Usage:**
   - Each individual \( i \) decides the amount \( A_i \) of the resource to use in each time step.
   - The total resource usage \( T \) is the sum of all \( A_i \) values.
   
2. **Resource Depletion and Replenishment:**
   - The resource level \( L \) decreases by \( T \) at each time step.
   - The resource level \( L \) increases by \( R \) at each time step.
   - The resource level \( L \) cannot exceed the carrying capacity \( C \).

3. **Utility Calculation:**
   - Each individual gains utility \( U_i \) proportional to their usage \( A_i \).
   - The total utility for each individual is impacted by the availability of the resource.

4. **Sustainability Check:**
   - If \( T > R \), the resource level \( L \) will eventually deplete.
   - If \( L \) reaches zero, the resource is exhausted, and no individual can gain utility from it.

**Simulation Objectives:**
- To observe how individuals' choices impact the resource over time.
- To identify thresholds where the resource becomes unsustainable.
- To understand the collective impact of individual actions on shared resources.
- To evaluate potential solutions or regulations to prevent resource depletion.

**Simulation Scenarios:**
- **Scenario 1: Unregulated Usage:** Individuals use the resource based solely on personal gain.
- **Scenario 2: Cooperative Strategy:** Individuals coordinate to use the resource sustainably.
- **Scenario 3: Regulated Usage:** External regulations limit individual usage to ensure sustainability.

**Expected Outcomes:**
- In Scenario 1, the resource is likely to be depleted quickly due to overuse.
- In Scenario 2, the resource may be maintained at a sustainable level if cooperation is effective.
- In Scenario 3, the resource is likely to be preserved due to enforced usage limits, but individuals' utilities might be lower compared to unregulated usage.

This simulation will help in understanding the dynamics of shared resource usage and the importance of cooperation or regulation to prevent the Tragedy of the Commons.
